# Using Python Creating a set of calculation questions 
Implementing an interactive math assessment system that dynamically generates mathematical questions and requires users to answer correctly before proceeding further in the assessment.

# Motivation
I developed this Python-based educational application designed to help users, especially children, enhance their mathematical problem-solving skills in a fun and engaging manner. The application generates random math problems for users to solve, measures their response times, and provides immediate feedback on their answers. This project aims to create an interactive learning experience that promotes numerical fluency and boosts mathematical confidence, particularly for children under the age of 10.

# Description
Programming Language: Python

Tools and Libraries:

1. Random Module: Utilized to generate random operands and operators for math problems.

2. Time Module: Used to measure the time taken to solve each problem and calculate the total time.

3. Eval Function: Employed to evaluate user-generated math expressions and determine the correctness of answers.

4. Conditional Statements: Used to validate user answers and provide feedback for incorrect responses.


# Educational Benefits

1. Promotes mathematical problem-solving skills.

2. Encourages quick thinking and numerical fluency.

3. Provides a fun and interactive learning experience.

4. Offers immediate feedback to enhance understanding.
